# Plausibility study
The repository presents a formalized evaluation process of responses obtained from a user study conducted to verify the plausibility of attacks proposed by ChatGPT, based on sensitive information disclosed within End-User Development (EUD) platforms such as IFTTT. The study involved the dissemination of an online questionnaire consisting of 20 multiple choice questions, followed by optional participant motivations. Responses from the user study, including plausibility values for each attack scenario and participant feedback, comments, and observations, were analyzed to determine the risk of releasing sensitive information.

The evaluation process consisted of two main phases:
1) Calculation of the plausibility score based on the total of all answers obtained.
2) Calculation of two separate plausibility scores, one for expert participants (with a programming background) and the other for non-expert participants (without a programming background).

This evaluation process rigorously calculated the plausibility of the proposed attacks and obtained valuable information to evaluate the perceived degree of danger by the participants. Additionally, an analysis of open answers helped to better understand the underlying motivations of the obtained answers.

The whole process is availablein the appropriate excel file inside the plausability test folder.
